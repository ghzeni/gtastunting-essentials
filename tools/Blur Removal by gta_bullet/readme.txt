sa-blur

0.1

this mod disables speed blur in san andreas. 
i am not sure if this works with other versions except "U.S. 1.0".

installation:
copy "sa-blur.asi" to your game's main directory, and try to speed up in a vehicle to see if it works.

requirements:
an asi loader. just search "san andreas asi loader" in a search engine to get one.
if you have "vorbisfile" and "vorbishooked" in your game directory, 
you already have it. dont need to download then.

future:
i might add a setting file to set blur level.
